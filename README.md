# match_geneExp_genotype.R

This script designs input files for matrix eQTL software.
Given a gene expression and genotype matrix of individuals along with their sample information.
I am designing two types of matrixeQTL runs (1) run Matrix eQTL separately for each colony; 
(2) given slopes are intact in the first step (means not changing between experimental groups); run 
a giant model for soldiers and foragers separately.

# MatrixeQTL.R 

This script runs Matrix eQTL program.
